This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

This is a very simple full stack React app that renders a graph from API data. 

## Set Up

After installing dependancies, we will fire up a server to fetch data and a frontend to serve up the response in a graph form.

In backend folder:

```shell
nodemon server.js
```

In frontend folder:

```shell
npm start
```
